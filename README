The BLAST Graphic Viewer provides a graphical visualization of the regions 
contained within HSPs relative to the query sequence. This distribution 
includes sample databases and a BLAST Search form. It is a component of 
the Generic Model Organism Systems Database project (www.gmod.org).

- To install see the INSTALL file

- For a demo, go to http://seq.yeastgenome.org/cgi-bin/GMOD/nph-blast.pl
 
- To download the Washington University BLAST(WU-BLAST), 
   go to http://blast.wustl.edu/

- To download the BLAT programs, 
   go to http://www.genomeblat.com/genomeblat/

- To download the NCBI BLAST programs, 
   go to http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/
 
- To download the sample databases, go to 
   ftp://genome-ftp.stanford.edu/pub/people/programmer/gmod/

- This graphic module will support BLASTN, BLASTP, BLASTX, TBLASTX, 
   TBLASTN, BLAT, and TBLATN. For the databases, it will support any fasta-
   formated datasets (i.e., nr, nt, etc). 

- The cgi program (nph-blast.pl) included in this
   distribution is used to display a BLAST/BLAT search form and 
   search result for BLAST or BLAT. It can be copied into any directory 
   under your cgi-bin. You can update the $CONF_FILE variable 
   in the top of this script to point to your own location of 
   the configuration file.

This is a free software. You can use it under the same terms as Perl
itself. Please see DISCLAIMER for limitations ...
