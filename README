The BLAST Graphic Viewer provides a graphical visualization of the regions 
contained within HSPs relative to the query sequence. This distribution 
includes sample databases and a BLAST Search form. It is a component of 
the Generic Model Organism Systems Database project (GMOD.sourceforge.net).

 - For a demo, go to http://seq.yeastgenome.org/cgi-bin/GMOD/nph-blast.pl
 
 - To download the Washington University BLAST(WU-BLAST), 
   go to http://blast.wustl.edu/

 - To download the BLAT programs, 
   go to http://www.genomeblat.com/genomeblat/

 - To download the NCBI BLAST programs, 
   go to http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/
 
 - To download the sample databases, go to 
   ftp://genome-ftp.stanford.edu/pub/people/programmer/gmod/

 - This graphic module will support BLASTN, BLASTP, BLASTX, TBLASTX, 
   TBLASTN, BLAT, and TBLATN. For the databases, it will support any fasta-
   formated datasets (i.e., nr, nt, etc). 

 - The cgi program (nph-blast.pl) included in this
   distribution is used to display a BLAST/BLAT search form and 
   search result for WU-BLAST or BLAT. It can be copied into any directory 
   under your cgi-bin. You can update the $CONF_FILE variable 
   in the top of this script to point to your own location of 
   the configuration file.

 - To set your own locations for blast programs, databases, filters,
   and matrix, and tmp directory for storing the png file, please 
   see the configuration file (conf/Blast.conf). You can copy this 
   file (Blast.conf) into any world readable directories.

 - To install this module on your own system, issue the following commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install   

 - Prerequisites: this module runs on top of several software packages. 
   These packages must be installed before you can run this viewer. 

	A)  	Apache Web Server -- http://www.apache.org
        		The Apache web server is the industry 
			standard open source
        		web server for Unix and Windows systems.

  	B) 	Perl 5.005 or higher-- http://www.cpan.org
        		The Perl language is widely used for web 
			applications.
        	
  	C)	Standard Perl modules -- http://www.cpan.org
        		The following Perl modules must be installed 
			for the Blast Graphic Viewer to work.
        		They can be found on CPAN:

		File::Listing
		File::Basename
		GD
		CGI
		

	D)	Bioperl modules --  http://www.bioperl.org
        		The following Bioperl modules must be installed
			for this viewer to work.	
	
		Bio::Root::IO
		Bio::SearchIO
		Bio::SearchIO::Writer::HTMLResultWriter
	

This is a free software. You can use it under the same terms as Perl
itself. Please see DISCLAIMER for limitations ...
